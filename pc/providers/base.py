"""The contract every provider implements, and the frame they all produce.

A provider is one AI tool we can learn usage from -- Claude today, Codex or
anything else later. A source is one *way* of learning it from that tool: the
CLI hook, an app's own cache file, a rollout log. One provider owns several
sources, and the sources disagree, so everything below is shaped by two
facts:

  - Every source is optional and every source can be absent, old, or wrong in
    a way it cannot detect. Nothing here may assume a reading exists.
  - The board must never be handed a confident number that came from a guess.
    That is why -1.0 is the unknown, not 0.0 -- 0.0 renders as "0% used",
    which is a stronger claim than "we don't have this". pc/statusline_source
    established that convention and the firmware already defaults to -1 on an
    absent key (proto.c, msg_get_double); this keeps one rule across all of it.

    A window that has just reset is at 0%. That is not an estimate -- it is
    what resetting means -- so there is a better answer available than "this
    number may be wrong", which is what marking the message stale says.

    It matters because the payload is only rewritten when Claude Code renders
    its status line. Between a reset at 03:00 and its owner sitting down at
    09:00, the old behaviour left the panel amber for six hours, announcing a
    problem that did not exist. Observed 2026-08-22: a five-hour window rolled
    over, the board flagged the whole message stale, and the weekly figure --
    which was perfectly good -- was dragged down with it.

    The reset time goes back to unknown rather than being guessed forward: the
    next five-hour window does not start until the next message, so there is
    no honest number to put there until Claude Code tells us one.

    STALENESS CHANGES THE ANSWER BUT NOT THE QUESTION, and getting that
    backwards was a field defect (reproduced 2026-09-02). This used to be
    skipped entirely on an old payload, on the reasoning that a three-day-old
    file has a long-past resets_at and any amount of usage may have happened
    since, so 0% would be the lie. The first half of that is right and the
    fallback it took was not: skipping the check did not fall back to
    "unknown", it fell back to the PRE-RESET percentage, which is not merely
    unvouched-for but definitely wrong -- and it threw away the rollover
    evidence with it, so a Claude Desktop sample taken before the same reset
    came back to the dial wearing its own stale=False. Two seconds either side
    of STALE_AFTER_S the panel went from a correct 0% to a confident green 78%
    for usage that had already been forgiven.

    So all three outputs are decided separately now:

      - The EPOCH the window emptied is reported either way. It is evidence
        about the past, and evidence does not rot with the file's mtime: the
        window ended when it ended, whatever age the reading has since
        reached. pc/normalizer needs it to refuse a newer reading from a
        source that cannot see reset times (this frame's own observed_at is
        the payload's mtime and can be long before the reset, so nothing else
        in the frame can carry that fact).
      - The RESET TIME is discarded either way. A stamp the clock has already
        passed is not a countdown -- protocol.secs_until refuses it -- and
        merge() reads its mere presence as "a source supplied a reset time",
        which silences the desktop burn rate. Neither is worth keeping for a
        window that has ended.
      - The PERCENTAGE is 0.0 only while the reading is fresh. On a stale one
        it goes to UNKNOWN, which is the third option the old comment was
        missing: it does not zero an old payload, and it does not re-offer a
        number for a window that no longer exists. It is also the convention
        pc/statusline_source._window() already sets up -- an absent
        percentage reads as -1 and not as a confident zero -- applied to a
        percentage we have positive evidence against rather than merely none
        for.

    Written for the Claude status line and moved here when Codex turned out
    to need it word for word. A Codex rollout is written only while Codex
    runs, so a reading taken at 98% four minutes before its window ended sat
    on the panel as 98% until the owner happened to open Codex again -- with
    its own `resets_at` in the past the whole time, proving it was over
    (measured 2026-10-01, docs/open-bugs/usage-merge-jitter.md). Same file
    written only when the tool is used, same reset stamp, same answer.
