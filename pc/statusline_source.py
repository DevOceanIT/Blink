"""Read Claude Code's statusline payload and map it to a board usage message.

This project handles no Anthropic credential. Claude Code owns the credential
and hands us the two numbers it has already computed; we read a file it wrote.
There is nothing here to authenticate with, and nothing to leak.

The payload is PUSHED by a running Claude Code process, so it can be absent or
old. Old is reported as `stale` rather than hidden -- a frozen meter presented
as live is the one failure mode worth designing against.

# writes this file only when it RENDERS its status line, which happens when
# the user is doing something. So the age of the file measures how long the
# person has been idle -- not how wrong the numbers are. On a real desk it
# made the panel flap amber/green every few minutes: observed alternating
# STALE -> usage -> STALE -> usage while its owner simply paused to read.
#
# The numbers do not rot with wall-clock time. They go wrong two ways, and
# both are checked below:
#   - the window they describe resets, after which the reading is definitely
#     wrong (usage went back to near zero and this file still says 47%).
#     That is `_window_has_reset`, and it is exact rather than a guess.
#   - usage happens somewhere we cannot see -- claude.ai, the phone app --
#     so an old reading can understate the truth. Nothing detects that, so
#     this bound stays as the backstop. Half an hour is long enough that
#     ordinary pauses are silent, short enough that a genuinely abandoned
#     Claude Code is not presented as live.
